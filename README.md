📝 Project Description  
In this project, I designed and developed a web document using HTML and CSS to create a personal resume (CV). This project was implemented as a practical application of the concepts and elements learned. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and to gain a deeper understanding of how HTML and CSS work together in building web pages. Each language was used according to its core purpose, following a clear and well-structured approach.

📌 Role of HTML in the Project  
HTML was used as the primary language to build the structure of the webpage and organize its content. It represents the backbone of the web document. Through this project, I learned how to use various HTML elements to create clear and semantic content, including:

- Using headings to organize the main sections such as name, specialization, profile, skills, and education.  
- Using paragraphs to write a personal summary that highlights academic background and interests.  
- Using unordered lists (ul / li) to present contact information, education, and languages in an organized way.  
- Using ordered lists (ol / li) to display certificates and training courses in a logical sequence.  
- Using anchor tags to link the resume with an email address, LinkedIn profile, and university website.  
- Using images (img) to display a personal photo and social media icons, while applying the alt attribute to improve accessibility.  
- Using tables to organize technical and personal skills clearly.  
- Using semantic elements such as header, section, article, and aside to improve page structure, readability, and meaning.  
- Using the meter element to visually represent language proficiency levels.

This helped me develop a solid understanding of how to build a structurally correct web page and how HTML elements contribute to organizing content and giving it clear meaning.

🎨 Role of CSS in the Project  
CSS was used to control the visual design and layout of the webpage. It played an essential role in improving the user experience and making the resume more attractive and readable.

In this project, I learned how to:  
- Control colors, fonts, and backgrounds to enhance the overall appearance of the resume.  
- Use CSS Grid to divide the page into a sidebar (aside) and a main content area (section).  
- Style images to make the personal photo circular and visually balanced.  
- Improve readability by managing spacing, alignment, and font sizes.  
- Make the page responsive using Media Queries, ensuring it works well on smaller screens.  
- Add print-specific styling using @media print to make the resume suitable for printing.

This allowed me to clearly understand the relationship between HTML and CSS, where HTML focuses on content and structure, while CSS focuses solely on presentation and design without affecting the content itself.

🔗 Integration Between HTML and CSS  
Through this project, I developed a clear understanding of how HTML and CSS integrate to create a complete web page:  
- HTML is used to structure and define the content.  
- CSS is used to control layout, styling, and enhance user experience.

This integration helped me improve my logical thinking in web design and strengthened my understanding of the fundamentals of Front-End Development.

✅ Conclusion  
This project represents a practical example of using HTML and CSS to build a well-structured and visually clear web document. It reflects my understanding of the core concepts and my ability to apply them in a real project that combines organization, design, and usability. This project is licensed under the MIT License.
